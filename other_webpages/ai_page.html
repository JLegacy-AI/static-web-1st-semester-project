                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Artificial Intelligence, or simply AI, is the term used to describe a machine’s ability to simulate human intelligence. Actions like learning, logic, reasoning, perception, creativity, that were once considered unique to humans, is now being replicated by technology and used in every industry.
                        A common example of AI in today’s world is Chatbots, specifically the “live chat” versions that handle basic customer service requests on company websites. As technology evolves, so does our benchmark for what constitutes AI.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Artificial intelligence (AI) traditionally refers to an artificial creation of human-like intelligence that can learn, reason, plan, perceive, or process natural language.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Artificial intelligence is further defined as “narrow AI” or “general AI”. Narrow AI, which we interact with today, is designed to perform specific tasks within a domain (e.g. language translation). General AI is hypothetical and not domain specific, but can learn and perform tasks anywhere. This is outside the scope of this paper. This paper focuses on advances in narrow AI, particularly on the development of new algorithms and models in a field of computer science referred to as machine learning.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Artificial Intelligence is a complex field with many components and methodologies used to achieve the final result — an intelligent machine. AI was developed by studying the way the human brain thinks, learns and decides, then applying those biological mechanisms to computers. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        As opposed to classical computing, where coders provide the exact inputs, outputs, and logic, artificial intelligence is based on providing a machine the inputs and a desired outcome, letting the machine develop its own path to achieve its set goal. This frequently allows computers to better optimize a situation than humans, such as optimizing supply chain logistics and streamlining financial processes <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        AI isn't the future of technology — it’s already here. Just look at how voice assistants like Google’s Home and Amazon's Alexa have have become more and more prominent in our lives. This will only continue as they learn more skills and companies build out their connected device ecosystems. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        And while AI is having an enormous impact on individuals with the smart home, an even larger impact can be felt in the e-commerce space. As the market becomes increasingly cluttered, personalization is one of the key ways retailers can differentiate themselves to consumers. In fact, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, retailers that have implemented machine learning technology for personalization see sales gains of 6-10% — a rate two to three times faster than retailers who haven’t. <br>   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        And for marketers, AI can make teams more creative and help companies make better management decisions by providing new insights and better data analysis. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Regardless of your industry, AI is everywhere. And it will change the way you do business. The question is: <b>Will you be ready?</b>   <br>

                    The Internet Society recognizes that understanding the opportunities and challenges associated with AI is critical to developing an Internet that people trust. This is particularly important as the Internet is key for the technology behind AI and is the main platform for its deployment; including significant new means of interacting with the network. This policy paper offers a look at the key things to think about when it comes to AI, including a set of guiding principles and recommendations to help make sound policy decisions. Of particular focus is machine learning, a specific approach to AI and the driving force behind recent developments.
