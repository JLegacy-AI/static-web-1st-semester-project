                        Artificial intelligence is a technology that is already impacting how users interact with, and are affected by the Internet. In the near future, its impact is likely to only continue to grow. AI has the potential to vastly change the way that humans interact, not only with the digital world, but also with each other, through their work and through other socioeconomic institutions – for better or for worse.
                        If we are to ensure that the impact of artificial intelligence will be positive, it will be essential that all stakeholders participate in the debates surrounding AI.
                        In this paper, we seek to provide an introduction to AI to policymakers and other stakeholders in the wider Internet ecosystem.

                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing technology, made possible by the Internet, that may soon have significant impacts on our everyday lives. AI traditionally refers to an artificial creation of human-like intelligence that can learn, reason, plan, perceive, or process natural language. These traits allow AI to bring immense socioeconomic opportunities, while also posing ethical and socio-economic challenges.

                        This policy paper offers a look at key considerations regarding AI, including a set of guiding principles and recommendations to help those involved in policy making make sound decisions. Of specific focus is machine learning, a particular approach to AI and the driving force behind recent developments. Instead of programming the computer every step of the way, machine learning makes use of learning algorithms that make inferences from data to learn new tasks.

                        At the same time, in this complex field, there are specific challenges facing AI, which include: a lack of transparency and interpretability in decision-making; issues of data quality and potential bias; safety and security implications; considerations regarding accountability; and, its potentially disruptive impacts on social and economic structures.                   
                    </p>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        In evaluating the different considerations and understanding the various challenges, the Internet Society has developed a set of principles and recommendations in reference to what we believe are the core “abilities”that underpin the value the Internet provides.

                        While the deployment of AI in Internet based services is not new, the current trend points to AI as an increasingly important factor in the Internet’s future development and use. As such, these guiding principles and recommendations are a first attempt to guide the debate going forward. They include: ethical considerations in deployment and design; ensuring the “Interpretability” of AI systems; empowering the consumer; responsibility in the deployment of AI systems; ensuring accountability; and, creating a social and economic environment that is formed through the open participation of different stakeholders.

                        Artificial intelligence (AI) has received increased attention in recent years. Innovation, made possible through the Internet, has brought AI closer to our everyday lives. These advances, alongside interest in the technology’s potential socio-economic and ethical impacts, brings AI to the forefront of many contemporary debates. Industry investments in AI are rapidly increasing, and governments are trying to understand what the technology could mean for their citizens.

                        The collection of “Big Data” and the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), has made a perfect environment for new AI applications and services to grow. Applications based on AI are already visible in healthcare diagnostics, targeted treatment, transportation, public safety, service robots, education and entertainment, but will be applied in more fields in the coming years. Together with the Internet, AI changes the way we experience the world and has the potential to be a new engine for economic growth.

                        <b>Machine learning – Algorithms that generate Algorithms</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Algorithms are a sequence of instructions used to solve a problem. Algorithms, developed by programmers to instruct computers in new tasks, are the building blocks of the advanced digital world we see today. Computer algorithms organize enormous amounts of data into information and services, based on certain instructions and rules. It’s an important concept to understand, because in machine learning, learning algorithms – not computer programmers – create the rules.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Instead of programming the computer every step of the way, this approach gives the computer instructions that allow it to learn from data without new step-by-step instructions by the programmer. This means computers can be used for new, complicated tasks that could not be manually programmed. Things like photo recognition applications for the visually impaired, or translating pictures into speech.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    The basic process of machine learning is to give training data to a learning algorithm. The learning algorithm then generates a new set of rules, based on inferences from the data. This is in essence generating a new algorithm, formally referred to as the machine learning model. By using different training data, the same learning algorithm could be used to generate different models. For example, the same type of learning algorithm could be used to teach the computer how to translate languages or predict the stock market.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Inferring new instructions from data is the core strength of machine learning. It also highlights the critical role of data: the more data available to train the algorithm, the more it learns. In fact, many recent advances in AI have not been due to radical innovations in learning algorithms, but rather by the enormous amount of data enabled by the Internet.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Although a machine learning model may apply a mix of different techniques, the methods for learning can typically be categorized as <b>Three</b> general types:
                   </p>
                   <h2>
                    Supervised learning: 
                    </h2>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    The learning algorithm is given labeled data and the desired output. For example, pictures of dogs labeled “dog” will help the algorithm identify the rules to classify pictures of dogs.
                   </p>
                   <h2>
                    Unsupervised learning:  
                    </h2>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    The data given to the learning algorithm is unlabeled, and the algorithm is asked to identify patterns in the input data. For example, the recommendation system of an e-commerce website where the learning algorithm discovers similar items often bought together.
                   </p>
                   <h2>
                    Reinforcement learning:

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    The algorithm interacts with a dynamic environment that provides feedback in terms of rewards and punishments. For example, self-driving cars being rewarded to stay on the road.
                   </p>

                    Machine learning is not new. Many of the learning algorithms that spurred new interest in the field, such as neural networks [7], are based on decades old research. [8] The current growth in AI and machine learning is tied to developments in three important areas:
                   </p>
                   <h2>

                    Just over 3 billion people are online with an estimated 17 billion connected devices or sensors. [9] That generates a large amount of data which, combined with decreasing costs of data storage, is easily available for use. Machine learning can use this as training data for learning algorithms, developing new rules to perform increasingly complex tasks.

                    As machine learning algorithms are used in more and more products and services, there are some serious factors must be considered when addressing AI, particularly in the context of people’s trust in the Internet:
                   </p>
                   <h2>
                       Socio-Economic Impacts
                   </h2>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    The new functions and services of AI are expected to have significant socio-economic impacts. The ability of machines to exhibit advanced cognitive skills to process natural language, to learn, to plan and to perceive, makes it possible for new tasks to be performed by intelligent systems, sometimes with more success than humans. [12] New applications of AI could open up exciting opportunities for more effective medical care, safer industries and services, and boost productivity on a massive scale.
                   </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        transparency and “interpretability”. With artificial intelligence performing tasks ranging from self-driving cars to managing insurance payouts, it’s critical we understand decisions made by an AI agent. But transparency around algorithmic decisions is sometimes limited by things like corporate or state secrecy or technical literacy. Machine learning further complicates this since the internal decision logic of the model is not always understandable, even for the programmer. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Data Quality and Bias

                        In machine learning, the model’s algorithm will only be as good as the data it trains on – commonly described as “garbage in, garbage out”. This means biased data will result in biased decisions. For example, algorithms performing “risk assessments” are in use by some legal jurisdictions in the United States to determine an offenders risk of committing a crime in the future. If these algorithms are trained on racially biased data, they may assign greater risk to individuals of a certain race over others. [14] Reliable data is critical, but greater demand for training data encourages data collection. This, combined with AI’s ability to identify new patterns or re-identify anonymized information, may pose a risk to users’ fundamental rights as it makes it possible for new types of advanced profiling, possibly discriminating against particular individuals or groups.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        The problem of minimizing bias is also complicated by the difficulty in understanding how a machine learning model solves a problem, particularly when combined with a vast number of inputs. As a result, it may be difficult to pinpoint the specific data causing the issue in order to adjust it. If people feel a system is biased, it undermines the confidence in the technology.

                        As the AI agent learns and interacts with its environment, there are many challenges related to its safe deployment. They can stem from unpredictable and harmful behavior, including indifference to the impact of its actions. One example is the risk of “reward hacking” where the AI agent finds a way of doing something that might make it easier to reach the goal, but does not correspond with the designer’s intent, such as a cleaning robot sweeping dirt under a carpet.

                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        The safety of an AI agent may also be limited by how it learns from its environment. In reinforcement learning this stems from the so-called exploration/exploit dilemma. This means an AI agent may depart from a successful strategy of solving a problem in order to explore other options that could generate a higher payoff. [16] This could have devastating consequences, such as a self-driving car exploring the payoff from driving on the wrong side of the road.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        There is also a risk that autonomous systems are exploited by malicious actors trying to manipulate the algorithm. The case of “Tay”, a chatbot deployed on Twitter to learn from interactions with other users, is a good example. It was manipulated through a coordinated attack by Twitter users, training it to engage in racist behavior. [17]  Other examples of so-called “adversarial learning” include attacks that try to influence the training data of spam filters or systems for abnormal network traffic detection, so as to mislead the learning algorithm for subsequent exploitation. [18]

                        The ability to manipulate the training data, or exploit the behavior of an AI agent also highlights issues around transparency of the machine learning model. Disclosing detailed information about the training data and the techniques involved may make an AI agent vulnerable to adversarial learning. Safety and security considerations must be taken into account in the debate around transparency of algorithmic decisions.

                        Accountability. The strength and efficiency of learning algorithms is based on their ability to generate rules without step-by–step instructions. While the technique has proved efficient in accomplishing complex tasks such as facerecognition or interpreting natural language, it is also one of the sources of concern.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        When a machine learns on its own, programmers have less control. While non-machine learning algorithms may reflect biases, the reasoning behind an algorithm’s specific output can often be explained. It is not so simple with machine learning.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Not being able to explain why a specific action was taken makes accountability an issue. Had “Tay”, the chatbot that engaged in racist behavior as mentioned in the prior section, broken a law (such as issuing criminal threats), would its programmers be held accountable? Or would the twitter users who engaged in adversarial training?
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        In most countries, programmers are not liable for the damages that flaws in their algorithms may produce. This is important, as programmers would likely be unwilling to innovate if they were. However, with the advancement of IoT technologies, such issues may become more immediate. As flaws in algorithms result in greater damages, there is a need for clarified liability on the part of the manufacturer, operator, and the programmer. With AI, the training data, rather than the algorithm itself, may be the problem. By obscuring the reasoning behind an algorithm’s actions, AI further complicates the already difficult questioon of software liability. And as with many fields, it may well be liability that drives change.

                        The institutions, processes and organizations involved in the governance of AI are still in the early stages. To a great extent, the ecosystem overlaps with subjects related to Internet governance and policy. Privacy and data laws are one example.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Existing efforts from public stakeholders include the UN Expert Group on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS), as well as regulations like the EU’s recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the “right to explanation” of algorithmic decisions. [21] How such processes develop, and how similar regulations are adopted or interpreted, will have a significant impact on the technology’s continued development. Ensuring a coherent approach in the regulatory space is important, to ensure the benefits of Internet-enabled technologies, like AI, are felt in all communities.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        A central focus of the current governance efforts relates to the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence and its implementation. For example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has released a new report on Ethically Aligned Design in artificial intelligence [22], part of a broader initiative to ensure ethical considerations are incorporated in the systems design. Similarly, OpenAI, a non-profit research company in California has received more than 1 billion USD in commitments to promote research and activities aimed at supporting the safe development of AI. Other initiatives from the private sector include the “Partnership on AI”, established by Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Apple and Microsoft “to advance public understanding of artificial intelligence technologies (AI) and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field”.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        Despite the complexity of the field, all stakeholders, including governments, industry and users, should have a role to play to determine the best governance approaches to AI. From market-based approaches to regulation, all stakeholders should engage in the coming years to manage the technology’s economic and social impact. Furthermore, the social impact of AI cannot be fully mitigated by governing the technology, but will require efforts to govern the impact of the technology.

                        The Internet Society has developed the following principles and recommendations in reference to what we believe are the core “abilities” [23] that underpin the value the Internet provides. While the deployment of AI in Internet based services is not new, the current trend points to AI as an increasingly important factor in the Internet’s future development and use. As such, these guiding principles and recommendations are a first attempt to guide the debate going forward. Furthermore, while this paper is focused on the specific challenges surrounding AI, the strong interdependence between its development and the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) demands a closer look at interoperability and security of IoT devices.
